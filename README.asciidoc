[quote, HTML spec editor at Google, Ian Hickson]
____

Reducing kilobytes of data to 2 bytes is more than "a little more byte efficient", and reducing latency from 150ms (TCP round trip to set up the connection plus a packet for the message) to 50ms (just the packet for the message) is far more than marginal. In fact, these two factors alone are enough to make WebSocket seriously interesting to Google.
